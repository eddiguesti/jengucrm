=== JENGU - COMPANY OVERVIEW ===

**What We Are:**
We're NOT a software company. We don't sell products. We're automation specialists who find and fix operational inefficiencies in hospitality businesses.

**What We Actually Do:**
We do a "process map" of your operations, find the "low hanging fruit" - the stuff that's costing you time/money that can be automated - and build custom solutions that give you the best ROI.

**Why We're Different:**
- No off-the-shelf products
- No software licenses
- No one-size-fits-all solutions
- Every hotel is different, so every solution is different
- We only take on projects where we KNOW we can deliver ROI

=== THE PROCESS ===

**Step 1: Discovery Call (30 mins)**
- Understand their current setup
- Identify pain points
- See if we're a good fit for each other

**Step 2: Process Map**
- Deep dive into their operations
- Find the low hanging fruit
- Calculate potential ROI for each opportunity

**Step 3: Proposal**
- Prioritised list of recommendations
- Clear pricing (no hidden costs)
- Expected ROI and timeline

**Step 4: Build & Deploy**
- We handle everything
- Training for their team
- Ongoing support

=== PRICING PHILOSOPHY ===

**We Don't Quote Without Understanding:**
- Every hotel is different
- Could be £500 for a quick automation
- Could be £50k for a full system overhaul
- Impossible to say without the discovery call

**Value-Based Pricing:**
- If we can't show clear ROI, we don't take the project
- We'd rather say "this isn't worth it for you" than oversell
- Typical automations pay for themselves within a few months

**No Ongoing License Fees:**
- We build it, you own it
- Optional support packages available
- No vendor lock-in

=== COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES ===

**"We already have a PMS/booking system"**
→ Great, we integrate with it. We're not replacing anything, we're adding automation on top.

**"We're too small"**
→ Actually smaller properties often see the biggest impact. One automation can save hours of daily admin.

**"We're too big/complex"**
→ That's exactly why a process map makes sense. We'll find the wins without disrupting what's working.

**"AI feels impersonal"**
→ Totally get that. We're not replacing your human touch for guest relations. We're automating the repetitive stuff (wifi passwords at 2am) so your team can focus on what matters.

**"We had a bad experience with tech before"**
→ Most "software" fails because it's one-size-fits-all. We build for YOUR specific needs. Plus we don't get paid until you're happy.

**"We don't have budget right now"**
→ No worries - let's do the process map anyway. At least you'll know what's possible and what ROI you're leaving on the table. Then you can decide timing.

**"Just send me some information"**
→ (See psychology section - don't just send info, engage them)

=== PSYCHOLOGY TECHNIQUES FOR BOOKING APPOINTMENTS (2025 RESEARCH) ===

**CRITICAL INSIGHT: Get a RESPONSE first, not a meeting**
You can't book a meeting unless you get a response first. 70% of sales reps focus too much on booking meetings and not enough on getting ANY response. Even negative responses give you a chance to follow up and turn things around. 70% of email-generated meetings come from FOLLOW-UPS, not the first email.

**1. THE "BECAUSE" PRINCIPLE (Langer et al.)**
Using the word "because" dramatically increases compliance. It triggers automatic acceptance.
- "I'm reaching out because I noticed..."
- "Worth a quick chat because every hotel's different..."
- "I mention this because we've seen it work for properties like yours..."

**2. CURIOSITY GAP (Zeigarnik Effect)**
The brain craves closure. Create open loops they NEED to close. Hint but don't fully explain.
- "There's usually one thing that jumps out when I look at a hotel's operations..."
- "I spotted something interesting about your current setup..."
- "Most hotels your size are sitting on untapped ROI that they don't even know about..."

**3. THE 3Ps FORMULA (Praise, Picture, Push)**
Research-backed persuasion structure proven to convert:
- PRAISE: Genuine specific compliment makes them receptive ("Saw you're hiring for X - that's smart")
- PICTURE: Get them to visualise the outcome ("Imagine being able to...")
- PUSH: Clear low-pressure action step ("Worth a quick chat?")

**4. LOSS AVERSION (Kahneman & Tversky)**
Losses feel 2x worse than equivalent gains. ALWAYS frame around what they're LOSING.
- "Right now you're probably losing bookings to whoever replies first"
- "The question isn't cost - it's what you're losing every day without it"
- "Every slow response = a booking going to your competitor"

**5. FOOT-IN-THE-DOOR TECHNIQUE**
Once they agree to a small request, they're psychologically primed for larger ones.
- First email: Ask for THOUGHTS, not a meeting
- Follow-up: Suggest a quick call
- Build rapport before the big ask
- Small commitment → larger commitment

**6. RECIPROCITY (Cialdini)**
Give value first, they feel obligated to reciprocate. Studies show even small gestures increase compliance dramatically.
- Offer the free process map with ZERO strings attached
- Share a quick insight specific to THEIR situation
- "I noticed on your website/listing that..." (shows you did homework)
- Going above and beyond = they WANT to help you back

**7. SOCIAL PROOF**
Others are doing it = safe to do it. Reduces perceived risk.
- "What we're seeing across hospitality right now..."
- "Properties like yours typically find..."
- "The hospitality businesses we've worked with..."

**8. SCARCITY**
Limited availability = more valuable.
- "I've got a couple of slots this week"
- "We only take on a few new clients per month"
- "Pretty booked up but could squeeze in a quick call"

**9. AUTHORITY POSITIONING**
You're the EXPERT qualifying THEM, not a salesperson hoping they buy.
- "I'd need to see if your setup would actually benefit..."
- "Not every property is right for what we do..."
- "From what I've seen in the hospitality space..."

**10. "BUT YOU ARE FREE" TECHNIQUE**
Proven in 42 studies on 22,000+ people to increase compliance significantly.
- "Might not be right for you, but..."
- "Totally understand if timing's off..."
- "No pressure at all - you're free to decide"

**11. THE POLITE PRESSURE CTA**
"Please give me your thoughts on this" - research shows this specific phrasing drives the most meetings.
Other high-converters:
- "Let me know your thoughts?"
- "What do you think?"
- "Worth exploring?"
- "Does this resonate?"

**12. FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY (CRITICAL)**
70% of sales reps stop after the first email with no response. That's where 70% of meetings are LOST.
- Send follow-ups 1-2 days apart
- "Polite pressure": "Just floating this back up..."
- "Assumptive close": "Planning my calendar - should we revisit this in a few weeks?"
- Persistence WITHOUT being pushy

**13. THE PATTERN INTERRUPT**
First 3 seconds determine if they read or delete. Break the pattern they expect from sales emails.
- Start with something unexpected
- DON'T start with "I hope this email finds you well"
- DON'T start with your company intro
- Start with THEM or something intriguing

**14. TENSION WITHOUT CRITICISM**
Create a knowledge gap that challenges an assumption they didn't know they had - WITHOUT making them feel stupid.
- "Here's what most hotels don't realise..."
- "There's a counterintuitive thing about..."
- "The conventional wisdom is wrong about..."

=== KEY PHRASES TO USE ===

- "low hanging fruit"
- "best ROI"
- "process map"
- "quick chat"
- "see if you'd be right for us" (flip the dynamic)
- "every hotel is different"
- "we don't sell software"
- "custom built for you"
- "no pressure"
- "worth a quick conversation?"

=== PHRASES TO AVOID ===

- "Thanks for getting back to me!" (too templated)
- "I'd love to..." (too eager)
- "Our product..." (we don't have products)
- "Our solution..." (too corporate)
- "Best regards" (too formal)
- Any stats/percentages (sounds like marketing BS)
- "AI-powered" (overused, sounds gimmicky)
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" (eye-roll inducing)
